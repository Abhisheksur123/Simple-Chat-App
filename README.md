Documentation
Backend (backend/server.js)
The server uses Express and Socket.io to handle real-time communication. It listens for incoming connections, assigns users to a common chat room, and broadcasts messages to all connected clients.

Frontend (frontend/src/App.js)
The React app connects to the server using Socket.io. It allows users to input text and send messages. Received messages are displayed in real-time on the chat screen.
